/projects/saup0513/local/YingliProj/8SS_post_Intensity/parallelSimuMeta.py:134: GuessedAtParserWarning: No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system ("html.parser"). This usually isn't a problem, but if you run this code on another system, or in a different virtual environment, it may use a different parser and behave differently.

The code that caused this warning is on line 134 of the file /projects/saup0513/local/YingliProj/8SS_post_Intensity/parallelSimuMeta.py. To get rid of this warning, pass the additional argument 'features="html.parser"' to the BeautifulSoup constructor.
